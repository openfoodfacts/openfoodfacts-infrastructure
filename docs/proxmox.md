# Proxmox

On ovh1 and ovh2 we use proxmox to manage VMs.

**TODO** this page is really incomplete !

## Proxmox Backups

Every VM / CT is backuped twice a week using general proxmox backup, in a specific zfs dataset
(see Datacenter -> backup)

## Host network configuration

We configure network through virtual bridges (`vmbr<n>`) that are themselves linked to a physical network device.

Also note that [NGINX proxy] has it's own IP address on a separate bridge, so that it can get network traffic directly.

The local container normally sets their network to be `10.1.0.<ct number>/24`. But they route through `10.0.0.1` (or 2) and for that define the route to `10.0.0.1`. This is all managed by Proxmox.

### On OVH side

vmbr0 is the bridge for the local network.
vmbr1 is the public interface.

Name | Type | Active | Autostart | VLAN | Ports/Slaves | Bond Mode | CIDR | Gateway | Comment
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
enp5s0f0  | Network Device  | Yes  | No  | No  |   |   |   |   |   |
enp5s0f1  | Network Device  | Yes  | No  | No  |   |   |   |   |   |
vmbr0  | Linux Bridge  | Yes  | Yes  | No  | enp5s0f1  |   | 10.0.0.1/8  2001:41d0:0203:948c:1::1/80  |   |   |
vmbr1  | Linux Bridge  | Yes  | Yes  | No  | enp5s0f0  |   | 146.59.148.140/24  2001:41d0:0203:948c:0::1/80  | 146.59.148.254  2001:41d0:0203:94ff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff  |   |

### On OFF2 side

vmbr0 is the public interface.
vmbr1 is the bridge for the local network.

Name | Type | Active | Autostart | VLAN | Ports/Slaves | Bond Mode | CIDR | Gateway | Comment
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
eno1  | Network Device  | Yes  | No  | No  |   |   |   |   |   | 
eno2  | Network Device  | Yes  | No  | No  |   |   |   |   |   | 
vmbr0  | Linux Bridge  | Yes  | Yes  | No  | eno1  |   | 213.36.253.208/27  | 213.36.253.222  |   |
vmbr1  | Linux Bridge  | Yes  | Yes  | No  | eno2  |   | 10.0.0.2/8  |   | Internal network with VM and other free servers  |

This correspond to this settings in `/etc/network/interfaces` (generated by PVE)

```
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

iface eno1 inet manual

iface eno2 inet manual

auto vmbr0
iface vmbr0 inet static
	address 213.36.253.208/27
	gateway 213.36.253.222
	bridge-ports eno1
	bridge-stp off
	bridge-fd 0

auto vmbr1
iface vmbr1 inet static
	address 10.0.0.2/8
	bridge-ports eno2
	bridge-stp off
	bridge-fd 0
	post-up echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
	post-up   iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s '10.1.0.0/16' -o vmbr0 -j MASQUERADE
	post-down iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -s '10.1.0.0/16' -o vmbr0 -j MASQUERADE
#Internal network with VM and other free servers
```

**FIXME**: I added the last lines (post-up/down) myself, not sure if PVE would normally add them by itself ?

### Firewall

We use proxmox firewall on host. **FIXME** to be completed.

We have a masquerading rule for 10.1.0.1/24.

## Users and groups

We have a minimal set of users and groups.

*admin* group is for proxmox admins (*Administrator Role*). *ro_users* gives a read only access to the interface (*PVEAuditor* Role)

We put users (see users in proxmox interface) in groups (see groups in proxmox interface),
and give roles to users (see permissions in proxmox interface).

## Some Proxmox post-install thing

Remove enterprise repository and add the no-subscription one
```bash
rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-enterprise.list
echo "deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve "$(lsb_release --short --codename)" pve-no-subscription" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-install-repo.list
apt update
```

Verify smartclt is activated.

Interesting page: [Techno Tim](https://techno-tim.github.io/posts/first-11-things-proxmox/)

IOMMU ?

Don't forget to schedule [backups](#proxmox-backups).

## HTTP Reverse Proxy

The VM 101 is a http / https proxy to all services.

It has it's own bridge interface with a public facing ip.

See [Nginx reverse proxy](./nginx-reverse-proxy.md)

At OVH we have special DNS entries:
* `proxy1.openfoodfacts.org` pointing to OVH reverse proxy
* `off-proxy.openfoodfacts.org` pointing to Free reverse proxy

## Storage synchronization

VM and container storage are regularly synchronized to ovh3 (and eventually to ovh1/2) to have a continuous backup.

Replication can be seen in the web interface, clicking on "replication" section on a particular container / VM.

This is managed with command line `pvesr` (PVE Storage replication). See [official doc](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Storage_Replication)


## How to migrate a container / VM

You may want to move containers or VM from one server to another.

Just go to the interface, right click on the VM / Container and ask to migrate !

If you have a large disk, you may want to first setup replication of your disk to the target server (see [Storage synchronization](#storage-synchronization)), schedule it immediatly (schedule button)− and then run the migration.

## How to Unlock a Container

Sometimes you may get alerts in email telling backup failed on a VM because it is locked. (`CT is locked`)

This might be a temporary issue, so you should first verify in proxmox console if it's already resolved.

If not you can unlock it using this command:

```
pct unlock <vm-id>
```

## Storage

We use two type of storage: the NVME and zfs storage.
There are also mounts of zfs storage from ovh3.

**TODO** tell much more

### Bind mounting ZFS Datasets

You can bind mount folders on the host in the containers. This way you can also mount a zfs dataset in a container.

You cannot add them through the web interface, you can instead edit `/etc/pve/lxc/<container_id>.lxc` and add lines like:
`mp0 /absolute/path/on/host,mp=/absolute/path/in/container`.

Note that this will be available only after a reboot of the container: `pct retboot <container_id>` (or `start` if it was stopped).

See also [Proxmox documentation on mount points](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/chapter-pct.html#pct_mount_points)


### Adding space on a QEMU disk

see [How to add disk space on a qemu VM](./how-to-add-disk-space-on-qemu.md).

## Proxmox management interface access

### Create a proxmox user

This user will have the right to use proxmox administration.

see `sudo pveum help user add` and https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/User_Management#_command_line_tool

`userid`: use something like (for John Doe) `jdoe@pve`.

> **:Pencil: Note:** The user login is the part before `@pve`. Here our user will have to use `jdoe` as username and "Proxmox VE authentication server" as authentication service.

### Reset user password

To reset a user password, use `sudo pveum passwd <userid>`

### Read only group

On proxmox we created a read only group:
```bash
$ pveum group add ro_users -comment "Read only users"
$ pveum acl modify / -group ro_users -role -role PVEAuditor
```

### Admin group

On proxmox we created an administrators group:
```bash
$ pveum group add admin -comment "System Administrators"
$ pveum acl modify / -group admin -role Administrator
```

To add a user to admin group (here `jdoe@pve`):

```bash
$ pveum user modify jdoe@pve -group admin
```

## How to create a new Container

You need to have an account on the Proxmox infra.

Using web interface:
* Login to the Proxmox web interface
* Click on "Create CT"
* Note carefully the container number (ct number)
* Use a "Hostname" to let people know what it is about. Eg. "robotoff", "wiki", "proxy"...
* set Nesting option (systemd recent versions needs it)
* keep "Unprivileged container" option checked… unless you know what you do.
* Password: put something complex and forget it, as we will connect through SSH and not the web interface (`pwgen 20 20` is your friend)
* Create a root password - forget about it also (you will use `pct enter` or `lxc-attach`)
* Choose template (normally debian)
* Disk: try to keep a tight disk space and to avoid using nvme if it's not useful.
* Swap: you might choose 0B (do you really need swap ?) or a sensible value
* Network:
  * Bridge: vmbr0 (may vary, currently vmbr1 on off2 !) - the one which is an "Internal network"
  * IPv4: `10.1.0.<ct number>/24`
    (you need to use /24; end of IPv4 should be the same as the Proxmox container id; container 101 has the 10.1.0.101 IP).
  * Gateway: `10.0.0.1` (may vary, `10.0.0.2` on off2 or ovh2 !)
* Start the server after install

Wait for container to be created and started !

Then connect to the proxmox host:

  * Install useful package and do some other configurations:
    `sudo /root/cluster-scripts/ct_postinstall` (or `/opt/openfoodfacts-infrastructure/scripts/proxmox-management/ct_postinstall`) choose the container ID when asked.

    See [scripts/proxmox-management/ct_postinstall](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-infrastructure/blob/develop/scripts/proxmox-management/ct_postinstall)

  * eventually disable systemd services that are not needed (and would crash on unprivileged containers):
    * [disable systemd-logind (see below)](#how-to-resolve-slow-ssh-login-time-in-container)
    * `sudo systemctl disable --now sys-kernel-config.mount`
    * running `sudo systemctl list-unit --state=failed` is a good idea

  * [create a user](#how-to-create-a-user-in-a-container-or-vm), most of the time you prefer off to have id 1000.

Then you can login to the machine (see [logging in to a container or VM](#logging-in-to-a-container-or-vm)).

Using the web interface:

* Check "options" of the container and:
  * Start at boot: Yes
  * Protection: Yes (to avoid deleting it by mistake)

* Eventually Add replication to ovh3 or off1/2 (if we are not using sanoid/syncoid instead)
  * In the Replication menu of the container, "Add" one
  * Target: ovh3
  * Schedule: */5 if you want every 5 minutes (takes less than 10 seconds, thanks to ZFS)

Also think about [configuring email](./mail.md#postfix-configuration) in the container

## Logging in to a container or VM

Most of the time we use ssh to connect to containers and VM. See [how to create a user in a Container or VM](#how-to-create-a-user-in-a-container-or-vm)

For the happy few sudoers on the host, they can attach to containers using `pct enter <num>` (or `lxc-attach -n <num>`) where `<num>` is the VM number.
This gives a root console in the container and has the advantage of not depending on the container network state.

## how to create a user in a Container or VM

If you add a user which is not a person that needs ssh account (eg. the off service account), just open the console and the `adduser` command.

The `sudo /root/cluster-scripts/mkuser` (see script [mkuser](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-infrastructure/blob/develop/scripts/proxmox-management/mkuser))  helps you create users using github keys.

Alternatively `sudo /root/cluster-scripts/mkuseralias` can be used if the username on server is different from the GitHub username.

## How to resolve slow ssh login time in container

If when you ssh to a container it takes a long time, here is a possible fix:

See https://gist.github.com/charlyie/76ff7d288165c7d42e5ef7d304245916:

```
# If Debian 11 is ran on a LXC container (Proxmox), SSH login and sudo actions can be slow
# Check if in /var/log/auth.log the following messages 
Failed to activate service 'org.freedesktop.login1': timed out (service_start_timeout=25000ms)

-> Run  `systemctl mask --now systemd-logind`
-> Run `pam-auth-update` (and deselect `Register user sessions in the systemd control group hierarchy`)
```

## Proxmox installation

Proxmox is installed from a bootable USB disk based on Proxmox VE iso, the way you would install a Debian.


## Some errors

### Systemd needs nesting capability

Some service of systemd might not work because it needs nesting capabilities (and AppArmor is blocking them).

Using `systemctl list-units --failed`, one can see that `systemd-networkd` is down, might be same for `systemd-logind` and `systemd-resolved`.

Some logs that may appear:
```log
systemd-networkd "Failed to set up mount namespacing" "/run/systemd/unit-root/proc" "Permission denied" lxc
nov. 28 18:40:57 proxy systemd[123]: systemd-networkd.service: Failed to set up mount namespacing: /run/systemd/unit-root/proc: Permission denied
nov. 28 18:40:57 proxy systemd[123]: systemd-networkd.service: Failed at step NAMESPACE spawning /lib/systemd/systemd-networkd: Permission denied
```

On symptom is a slow time at login time, which is due to systemd-logind service being down:

```log
Mar 29 10:37:53 proxy dbus-daemon[128]: [system] Failed to activate service 'org.freedesktop.login1': timed out (service_start_timeout=25000ms)
Mar 29 10:42:43 proxy dbus-daemon[128]: [system] Failed to activate service 'org.freedesktop.login1': timed out (service_start_timeout=25000ms)
```

Just add nesting capability to the container and restart it.
