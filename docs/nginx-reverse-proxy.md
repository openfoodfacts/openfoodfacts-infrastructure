# NGINX Reverse proxy

At OVH and at Free we have a LXC container dedicated to reverse proxy http/https applications.

It serves applications that are located in servers at the same provider (and same Proxmox cluster).

## Network specific interface

It as a specific network configurations with two ethernet address:
* one internal, to communicate with other VMs
* one which is bridged on host network card, with ip fail over mechanism.

**Important**: only the public ip should have a gateway [^proxmox_multiple_gateway]

## Never call an internal service using reverse proxy

**Important**: Because of above limitation [^proxmox_multiple_gateway],
if a service use another service which is on the same proxmox cluster,
it should use it's internal address and not the public / reverse proxy address,
otherwise packets routing will be broken, and request will never land.


[^proxmox_multiple_gateway]: The default proxmox interface does not offer options to indicate which gateway should be the default gateway, and the public ip needs to have its gateway as the default one, and there is no trivial way to achieve this reliably and elegantly, thus the best solution is to have only one gateway.

## Banning bots

We ban bots from the reverse proxy (more efficient and centralized).
Most of the time this is a manual ban.

See [How to use fail2ban to ban bots](./how-to-fail2ban-ban-bots.md)

## Configuring a new service

To make a new service, hosted on Proxmox, available you need to:

* have this service available on proxmox internal network
* in the DNS, CNAME you service name to
  * `proxy1.openfoodfacts.org` for OVH (ovh1..3)
  * `off-proxy.openfoodfacts.org` for Free (off1..2)
* write a configuration on nginx for this service
* eventually add https


### Steps to create Nginx configuration

Imagine we have to configure **my-service.openfoodfacts.net**, to route request to container `222`, port `8888`.

You will have to be root to do that.

Login on the Nginx reverse proxy container (101) and launch a Bash session as root.

Create the basic configuration file for your service in `/etc/nginx/conf.d` directory, named after your service, eg. `my-service.openfoodfacts.net.conf`.

**Important**: your file has to ends with `.conf` to be taken into account.

It's a good idea to first test it exists, using nc and curl:

```bash
nc -vz 10.1.0.222 8888
curl  http://10.1.0.222:8888
```

Create a config, say:

```nginx
server {

    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name  my-service.openfoodfacts.net;

    access_log  /var/log/nginx/my-service.off.net.log  main;
    error_log   /var/log/nginx/my-service.off.net.err;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://10.1.0.222:8888$request_uri;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
        proxy_read_timeout 90;
        client_max_body_size 512M;
    }

}
```

If you need more [nginx docs are here](https://nginx.org/en/docs/)

We test nginx configuration is ok (**Mandatory**)[^test-nginx]:

```bash
$ nginx -t
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
```

if it's ok, we reload.
```bash
$ systemctl reload nginx
```

Next step is probably to setup https (putting something in http should be an exception, with good reason for that !)
Otherwise jump to [EtcKeeper](#etc-keeper)

[^test-nginx]: the nginx script will normally do the check before trying to restart nginx, but this way you are able to also see warnings.

### How to add https

Most of the time https certificates are managed on the nginx reverse proxy VM. Here is how to configure them to enable https.

We use certbot to manage certificates.

First prepare the service definition to answer on port 443 and 80. That is:

- change your current configuration to listen on 443:
  ```nginx
  {
    server {

    listen 443;
    listen [::]:443;
    server_name  my-service.openfoodfacts.net;
    …
  ```
- but after it, add a new bare section for port 80:
  ```nginx
  server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name  my-service.openfoodfacts.net;
  }
  ```

We will first validate our config using `--test-cert` option (**WARNING** only skip this part if you really are used to certbot and nginx configuration, as after five tentatives, we won't be able to renew any certificates on the domain for one full week, and if you do too much error, the IP itself might be out of limit, see [letsencrypt Rate limits](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/))

```
$ certbot --test-cert -d my-service.openfoodfacts.net
…
Enter email address (used for urgent renewal and security notices) (Enter 'c' to
cancel): root@openfoodfacts.org
…
terms of service…
(A)gree/(C)ancel: A
…
share email…
(Y)es/(N)o: n

Obtaining a new certificate
Performing the following challenges:
http-01 challenge for my-service.openfoodfacts.net
Waiting for verification...
Cleaning up challenges
Deploying Certificate to VirtualHost /etc/nginx/conf.d/my-service.openfoodfacts.net.conf
```

**Note:** verify it's the right file which has been impacted ! If it's not you may have the option to restore the file with `git checkout wrong-touched-file` (but look before with `git status`)

Test it's working (apart from the security alert in your browser, because certificate is from an unknown issuer).

Then install the real certificate (you get the first section if you first did a test certificate):

```
$ certbot -d my-service.openfoodfacts.net
1: Attempt to reinstall this existing certificate
2: Renew & replace the cert (limit ~5 per 7 days)
Select … [enter] (press 'c' to cancel): 2
…
Enter email address (used for urgent renewal and security notices) (Enter 'c' to
cancel): root@openfoodfacts.org
…
terms of service…

…

```

Test again if it's working

#### Multiple domains

If you're in the case where same configuration must serve multiple domains, like ui.my-site.openfoodfacts.net and api.my-site.openfoodfacts.net,
simply add all those domain to the certbot command with the `-d` parameters.

For example:

```bash
certbot -d ui.my-site.openfoodfacts.net -d api.my-site.openfoodfacts.net -d my-site.openfoodfacts.net
```

If a certificate already exists for a domain, certbot will propose to extend it with the other domains.

### Wildcard certificates

Certbot can deliver wildcard certificates for domains based on DNS challenges. So you need a plugin for your DNS provider.

In our case, this is the plugin for ovh. Installing `python3-certbot-dns-ovh` did works in our case.

Access tokens are stored in /root/.ovhapi/<domain-name> and are only readable by root (0600).

#### How to add wildcard certificates

Official documentation: https://certbot-dns-ovh.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ and https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=nginx&os=debianbuster
Official documentation requires snapd… we are not keen on that, and moreover, in a lxc container [it does not seems to work well](https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/cant-install-snap-in-lxc-container.68708/).
So we go the alternate way, using the debian package.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-dns-ovh
```

Here we will use openpetfoodfacts.org as the domain name.

Generate credential, following https://eu.api.ovh.com/createToken/

(useful resource for [OVH keys management](https://gandrille.github.io/linux-notes/Web_API/OVH_API/OVH_API_Keys_management.html))

Using:
* GET `/domain/zone/`
  (Note: the trailing slash is important !)
* GET/PUT/POST/DELETE `/domain/zone/openpetfoodfacts.org/*`

![token creation at form at OVH](img/2023-05-ovh-create-token-openfoodfacts.org-form.png "token creation at form at OVH"){width=50%}
![token creation result](img/2023-05-ovh-create-token-openfoodfacts.org-result.png "token creation result"){width=50%}

and we put config file in `/root/.ovhapi/openpetfoodfacts.org`
```bash
$ mkdir /root/.ovhapi
$ vim /root/.ovhapi/openpetfoodfacts.org
...
$ cat /root/.ovhapi/openpetfoodfacts.org
# OVH API credentials used by Certbot
dns_ovh_endpoint = ovh-eu
dns_ovh_application_key = ***********
dns_ovh_application_secret = ***********
dns_ovh_consumer_key = ***********

# ensure no reading by others
$ chmod og-rwx -R /root/.ovhapi
```

Try to get a wildcard using certbot, we will choose to obtain certificates using a DNS TXT record, and use tech -at- off.org for notifications
```bash
$ certbot certonly --test-cert --dns-ovh --dns-ovh-credentials /root/.ovhapi/openpetfoodfacts.org -d openpetfoodfacts.org -d "*.openpetfoodfacts.org"
...
Plugins selected: Authenticator dns-ovh, Installer None
Requesting a certificate for openpetfoodfacts.org and *.openpetfoodfacts.org
Performing the following challenges:
dns-01 challenge for openpetfoodfacts.org
dns-01 challenge for openpetfoodfacts.org
Waiting 30 seconds for DNS changes to propagate
Waiting for verification...
Cleaning up challenges
...
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/openpetfoodfacts.org/fullchain.pem
```

Mow we can do a real certificate, by removing the `--test-cert` option. We will ask to renew & replace the existing certificate (as ith was a test one), when you are asked, choose to replace existing certificate:

```bash
$ certbot certonly --test-cert --dns-ovh --dns-ovh-credentials /root/.ovhapi/openpetfoodfacts.org -d openpetfoodfacts.org -d "*.openpetfoodfacts.org"
...
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/openpetfoodfacts.org/fullchain.pem
...
```

Now we install it on our website, we did it manually…
```conf
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name openpetfoodfacts.org *.openpetfoodfacts.org;

    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name openpetfoodfacts.org *.openpetfoodfacts.org;

    # SSL/TLS settings
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/openpetfoodfacts.org/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/openpetfoodfacts.org/privkey.pem;
    ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/openpetfoodfacts.org/chain.pem;

…
}
```


### Etc Keeper

We use [etckeeper](./linux-server.md#etckeeper)
Do not forget to commit your changes:

```bash
etckeeper commit -m "Configured my-service.openfoodfacts.net"
```

Now we are done 🎉

## Performance tips

### Use a buffer for access log

Use a buffer for access log for high traffic websites.
eg (for off server nginx):
```conf
    access_log /var/log/nginx/off-access.log proxied_requests buffer=256K flush=1s;
```



## Install

Install was quite simple: we simply install nginx package, as well as stunnel4.

Along with nginx, some other tools can be installed:
* apachetop: to analyze realtime web traffic
* [lnav](https://lnav.org/): to analyze logs

## Ipv6 configuration

An ipv6 address was added to the reverse proxy CT, so that the reverse proxy can reach `docker-prod-2` VM on Moji,
where Robotoff services are running. Moji server is currently only accessible through ipv6 as it does not have a public ipv4 address. See [Moji Datacenter](moji-datacenter.md) and [moji server installation report](reports/2024-08-13-moji-server-installation.md) for more information.
