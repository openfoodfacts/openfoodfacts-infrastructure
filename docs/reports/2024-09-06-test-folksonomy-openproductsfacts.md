# 2024-09-06 test folksonomy Open Products Facts

As we have a test to deploy of Open Products Facts, we wanted to test the folksonomy functionality.

But it can't work as it is today because of authentication problems.

## How it works

We use the session cookie to authenticate, and if we are using openproductsfacts.org,
the cookie is not the same as openfoodfacts.org (because cookies can't be shared between domains).

The best way to do it is to have folksonomy engine available on each domain:
* api.folksonomy.openfoodfacts.org
* api.folksonomy.openproductsfacts.org

Each of those authenticate to the corresponding world.<domain-name> domain,
so that each product opener site can call the corresponding folksonomy api,
which will in turn authenticate on the right website.


## Amend Folksonomy API

I changed folksonomy API so that it deduces the server to which to authenticate 
from the url it is called.

[See commit b6729d398](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/folksonomy_api/commit/b6729d3984e82005f6d3a04d96466c8a1f1959e3)

## Make Folksonomy API available on each domain

I changed DNS Zones at OVH to have:
* new.openproductsfacts.org CNAME openproductsfacts.org
* *.new.openproductsfacts.org CNAME openproductsfacts.org
* api.folksonomy.new.openproductsfacts.org CNAME proxy1.openfoodfacts.org
* api.folksonomy.openproductsfacts.org CNAME proxy1.openfoodfacts.org

I modified ovh reverse proxy file for folksonomy api, to add
api.folksonomy.openproductsfacts.org and api.folksonomy.new.openproductsfacts.org
to server_name in both http and https sections.

I then `nginx -t`  and `systemctl reload nginx`.

I then extend the certificate by running:
```bash
certbot -d 'api.folksonomy.openfoodfacts.org' -d 'api.folksonomy.openproductsfacts.org' -d 'api.folksonomy.new.openproductsfacts.org'
```
This ask me if I want to extend the existing certificate, I say yes.

See [commit fce11096a](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-infrastructure/commit/fce11096a902314bd4696741a7fcdc5a858838fb)

## Avoid basic auth

I still had a problem, because we put basic auth in front of `https://new.openproductsfacts.org` to avoid accidentally indexing it.
But this was preventing folksonomy service to use this auth api, as there was no way to add basic auth.
So I modified the new.openproductsfacts.org configuration on ovh reverse proxy to remove the basic auth for /cgi pathâ€¦ and it worked.
