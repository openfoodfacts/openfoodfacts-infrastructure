# Infrastructure overview

## Locations

We have servers hosted by two providers:

- [free.org](https://www.fondation-free.fr/) is sponsoring us electricity, network and server hosting.
  We have two servers:
  - off1.openfoodfacts.org
  - off2.openfoodfacts.org

- [OVH foundation](https://www.ovhcloud.com/) sponsors us three bare metal servers:
  - ovh1.openfoodfacts.org - strasbourg (sbg3)- [advance-5](https://www.ovhcloud.com/fr/bare-metal/advance/adv-5/) server
  - ovh2.openfoodfacts.org - roubaix (rbx8) - [advance-5](https://www.ovhcloud.com/fr/bare-metal/advance/adv-5/) server
  - ovh3.openfoodfacts.org - roubaix (rbx7) - [stor-2](https://www.ovhcloud.com/fr/bare-metal/advance/adv-stor-2/) server

- [Moji](https://moji.fr/) is also sponsoring us a good server

## Network

### web traffic proxies

- Most services are hosted on ovh,
  and pass through an nginx proxy (see [proxmox - HTTP Reverse Proxy](./proxmox.md#http-reverse-proxy)) 
  hosted on 101 VM on ovh1 which has a bridge with it's own ip.

- product opener instances (openfoodfacts.org and its cousins) have their own proxy on [off1](#off1)
- a specific nginx is also set on [ovh3](#ovh3) to serve images and some static resources


### Stunnel

We still need to deploy stunnel for clear text tcp services transiting through
(also to avoid ip rules)

### IP tables

We limit access to certain services through IP tables rules.
Notably:
- on off2 access to mongodb is filtered by ip to enable access from ovh

We also use IP tables rules to proxy services:
Notably:
- on ovh1 ip tables rules proxy PGM service requests coming from off1 and off2 (we could replace by stunnel)
