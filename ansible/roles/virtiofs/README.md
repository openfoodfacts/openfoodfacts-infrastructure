# Virtiofs

Setup the virtiofs daemon and directory mappings.

This is normally used on hosts.

[Virtiofs](https://gitlab.com/virtio-fs/virtiofsd) enables QEMU VMs directly access folders on the host system in an efficient manner.
It is [supported by Proxmox since 8.4](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/chapter-qm.html#qm_virtiofs)

In proxmox it means we can use ZFS datasets directly in the VM
instead of only ZFS volumes (which are opaque).
